# HOW IT WORKS?

Imaseq Player works by looking for supported images through the user-provided directory. It will make sure there are at least two images, and they are all within the allowed dimensions. The program will then sort the images by its file name, and display them in sequence base on the speed slider’s value. And when the status of Imaseq Player is in playing or paused, the user will have the option to save the images as an animated GIF.
